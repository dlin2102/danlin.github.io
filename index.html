        <p>I've always been an avid dreamer and loved creating something from nothing. At my past position, I was bored. The most exciting part of my job was maintaining our Wordpress site. Once I started exploring further into programming, I realized that it was a perfect fit for me. It was exciting and fun. The pool of knowledge is endless and you can singlehandedly bring your visions to life!
GA has been an amazing experience. I've been pushed to my limit and absorbed an insane amount of skills with the support of my fellow classmates, the GA community, and the DMV tech community. GA has equipped me with the tools, confidence, and technical skills to become a full stack developer. I am excited to continue to grow as a programmer and to create new and beautiful apps.</p>
